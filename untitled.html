			<p> Hello! My name is Kelly J. Kang and I am a senior at Barnard College. I was born in Los Angeles, but moved to Seoul, South Korea when I was 12. I came back to the States to receive an excellent education in New York City. I am interested in affecting change and hopefully making the world a better place in smart and efficient ways.</p>
